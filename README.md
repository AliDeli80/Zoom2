## How It Works

1. Event Listener: The script attaches an event listener to the image element.
2. Zoom on Hover: When the mouse hovers over the image, the script calculates the zoom factor based on the mouse position.
3. Image Transformation: The image is scaled and positioned using CSS transform property.
4. Smooth Transition: CSS transitions are used to provide a smooth zooming effect.

## Feature

- Smooth Transitions: Provides a smooth zooming experience using CSS transitions.

## Customization

- Zoom Factor: Adjust the zoom factor to control the level of magnification.
- Transition Duration: Modify the CSS transition duration to change the speed of the zoom effect.
- Image Size: Change the image size to affect the overall zoom effect.
- Hover Effect: Customize the hover effect, such as adding a shadow or changing the cursor.
